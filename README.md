# Ergo Index & Mutual Fund Platform (Frontend)
ErgoIndex is a non-custodial platform for pooling funds to invest in a portfolio of tokens on the Ergo blockchain.
The ultimate goal is for fund managers to be able to form portfolios containing tokens from a wide range of
blockchains. The website facilitates the creation of transactions and sends them to the network, but it never stores any user's private key.
